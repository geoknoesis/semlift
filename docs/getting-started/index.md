SemLift is a deterministic semantic lifting pipeline. It takes raw data, normalizes it into JSON, embeds a JSON-LD context, and produces RDF output with optional SHACL validation and SPARQL post-processing.

## What you will accomplish

In under 5 minutes you will:

1. Build the CLI.
2. Lift a small JSON payload to RDF.
3. Validate the result with SHACL.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17+ installed
- `jq` available on your PATH (used for pre-steps)

## Next steps

- `getting-started/installation/`
- `getting-started/quickstart/`
